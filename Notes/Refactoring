make a package to refactor the model, routes codes.
make a folder like 'market'
move everything to that folder
Create a new file outside our market folder like 'run.py'

run.py contains the crucial code to start the app.


Currently these lines are crucial:
from flask import Flask, render_template
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy


app = Flask(__name__)  # Here the __name__ is the same script name, we are in right now.
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///market.db'  # Here we pass the DB file name.
db = SQLAlchemy(app)  # initialize an instance of the db class. Pass the app name to the db object.

and needs to be moved to __init__.py
__init__.py

create __init__.py inside the market folders
